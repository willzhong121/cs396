# CS396 - Assignment 7
This codebase was created for the CS396 course at Northwestern University. It creates a random 3D lizard-like creature that wiggles around in an open environment. Most of the code was created by following Ludobots, an online course found at https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/. Ludobots makes use of the PyroSim modeling interface; the repository can be found at https://github.com/jbongard/pyrosim.git.
